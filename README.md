## Introduction <a name="Introduction"></a> <br>

Jason Jones LaTex Resume is my new resume designed specifically for internship applications in the Computer Science, Software Engineering, and Data Science fields.
The objective was to create a single-column resume to showcase skills and project experience over work experience. The goal is to polish this resume for the purpose 
of gaining a professional internship in the tech industry.
